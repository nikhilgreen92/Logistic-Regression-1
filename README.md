# Logistic-Regression-1
For data, we are using Titanic dataset wherein we are going to write algorithms based on Logistic Regression. 
The data contains 891 rows and 12 columns. 
Steps used--- 
a) Importing the dependencies like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn 
b) Importing the data to read what's contained in the dataset. 
c) Basic data exploration using head, info. 
d) EDA using countplot, histplot 
e) The null values in Age column are filled with the median values while some column will be removed from the analysis
f) Now we'll encode the categorical columns since machine understands numbers 
g) Train Test split the datset. 
h) Importing Logistic regression model 
i) Predictions to be done on testing dataset. j) Using classification report we try and find out the accuracy
j) Conclusion: From here we can dedude that the model built has the accuracy of 79% which leaves the scope for future to increase it to more accurate values.
